# Fun Math

After a young friend bemoaned the lack of anything fun in his school’s
math program, I typed up some notes on Newtonian gravity and how you
could use algebra—a *lot* of algebra—to derive interesting facts about
the universe, like “where between the earth and the moon do their
gravities cancel each other out?”

create it yourself from the source or send me an email and I’ll prepare
you one.
